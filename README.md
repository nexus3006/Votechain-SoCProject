Sample size of 2000 votes tested using Testing.py
**Follow these steps to simulate the voting process:**

To cast vote, enter your voter id (in the form 23b0xxx). For the project I have used voters in the range of 23b0301 to 23b0329 (check CSV file)

Enter password which is the last 3 digits of the voter id. For eg, password for 23b0314 is 314.

Now enter the candidate id; we have four candidates with ids 439, 688, 739 and 348 (check CSV file)

Once you enter the id, you will be prompted to check vote status vailidty, where you can enter YES or NO


**To access admin actions to check details of the election:**

Use voter id as admin1234 and password 30062005.

You will be shown 5 options, enter the option number to execute that action

Use 3 to check the details of blocks in the blockchain

4 will terminate the program (and therefore, the election) and declare the winner

Use 5 to log out and continue the voting process
